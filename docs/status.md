## Project Summary
The main idea of The Blockouts project is to create a counter siege AI. Counter siege, in this context, means the AI will try to survive as long as possible while trying to preventing enemies from crossing its border. The AI will take as input enemy locations, and enemy types. As output the AI will decide between moving, fighting, which enemy to attack and which weapon to use. We plan to add more input and output information as our project grows...


## Approach
For our project we are implementing a q-tabular reinforcement learning system inspired by assignment_2. 
<br>
<img src="images/reinforcement_learning1.jpg">
<br>
Our update function is based on the Bellman Equation for Q learning. 
<br>
$$ Q^\pi(s_t, a_t) = E[R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} +  \gamma^2 R_{t+3}... + [s_t, a_t]] $$
<br>
$$ \text{oldQValue} + [\alpha \times (\text{currentReward} + \gamma * \text{maxQValueForStateX} - \text{oldQValue})] $$

### Our states will consist of the following:
<ul>
    <li>Are there currently any zombies, endermen, or villagers alive (boolean)</li>
    <li>What type of entity is in the agentâ€™s line of sight (entity_dictionary)</li>
</ul>


### Our action states will consist of the following:
<ul>
    <li>Attacking with the swing of a bow (the agent will move to the entity in line of sight and start swiping at it with a bow)</li>
    <li>Attacking by shooting an arrow (the agent will move to the entity in the line of sight and start shooting arrows)</li>
    <li>Targeting a random entity (the agent will switch focus to an entity in the current line of sight)</li>
    <li>Doing nothing (the agent will wait for the next agent action sequence)</li>
</ul>

### Terminating States:
<ul>
    <li>Time runs out</li>
    <li>Agent dies</li>
</ul>


## Evaluation 
evaluate project. Present results to show reader that this is a working implementation. Plot charts tables etc... Few paragraphs

## Remaining Goal and Challenges
few paragraphs, goals for the next 2-3 weeks. Describe how you consider your prototype to be limited, and what you want to add.
