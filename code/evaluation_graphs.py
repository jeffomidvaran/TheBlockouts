############### EVALUATION_GRAPHS ################# 

''' 
If you can turn the following into functions that are usable
in final_project.py that would be super helpful
If there any other evaluations that you can think of that would be awesome 
as well.

Grading Agent's choice of who to attack:

We take multiple instances of states and resulting actions to see what was in the agentâ€™s line of sight when they chose to attack. We grade the agent on the percentage of times a harmful entity was in the line of sight vs a non-harmful entity. This is to show that the agent learns to prioritize harmful_entities while avoiding non-harmful entities.

Grading Reward: 
See status webpages for full description feel free to make changes if you need to

The reward metric is a percentage. Where the Agent receives a 100% if all of the harmful entities are killed and all of the non-harmful entities are left unharmed. To calculate this metric, the following formula is applied.

v = number of attacks needed to kill villager * reward for hitting villager
z = number of attacks needed to kill zombie * reward for hitting zombie
e = number of attacks needed to kill Endermen * reward for hitting Endermen

n v = total number of villagers
n z = total number of zombies
n e = total number of Endermen

n v k = total number of villagers killed
n z k = total number of zombies killed 
n e k = total number of Endermen killed
